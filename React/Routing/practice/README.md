<h1 class="text-center">Routing Practice</h1>
<p>Create a simple React app that can handle the following routes:</p>
<p>1. localhost:3000/home: This should display the home page, with a generic "Welcome" heading</p>
<p>2. localhost:3000/4: This should display the number "4", or any other number that was sent through</p>
<p>3. localhost:3000/hello: This should display the word "hello" or any other word that was sent through</p>
<p>4. localhost:3000/hello/blue/red: This should display the word "hello" in blue text with a red background. It should work with any other valid word and colors.</p>
<p> Hint: use the <code> isNaN </code> method (is Not a Number). For example: <code>isNaN(+"35")</code> is <code>false, isNaN(+"hello")</code> is <code>true</code></p>
