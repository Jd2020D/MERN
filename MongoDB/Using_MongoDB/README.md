<h1>Using MongoDB</h1>
<p> Create a database called 'my_first_db'.</p>
<p> Create students collection.</p>
<p> Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})</p>
<p> Create 5 students with the appropriate info.</p>
<p> Get all students.</p>
<p> Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).</p>
<p> Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3</p>
<p> Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10</p>
<p> Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)</p>
<p> Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY. It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.</p>
<p> Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.</p>
<p> Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.</p>
<p> Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.</p>
<p> Remove all students who are from California.</p>
<p> Remove a student by name.</p>
<p> Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)</p>
<p> Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.</p>
<p> Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).</p>
<p> Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'</p>
<p> Remove the 'lucky_number' field.</p>
<p> Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.</p>
